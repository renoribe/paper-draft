# Satori = Basis Rotation Hypothesis  
― Catastrophic Shift as a Phase Transition of the Mind ―  
Understanding Spiritual Transformation through AI and Vector Spaces

## Introduction
For centuries, humanity has asked: *What is enlightenment (satori)?*  
In Buddhism, satori is the state of seeing the world as it truly is, free from suffering. In Christianity and Islam, too, moments of “spiritual conversion” are described in similar terms.  

Yet in the language of science and philosophy, there are few clear explanations of enlightenment.  
Here, I propose a new perspective by using metaphors from AI research and vector spaces.  

This is the **“Satori = Basis Rotation Hypothesis.”**

## Vectors and the Mind
AI processes words and images as “embedding vectors.”  
For example, the words *dog* and *cat* are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space, with positions and directions.  
Contextual and semantic differences are captured as angles and distances between vectors.  

What if qualia—human sensations and the felt quality of consciousness—are also represented as multidimensional vectors?  
If so, illusions and synaesthesia can be explained as phenomena of *proximity or interference within the vector space*.

## What Is Basis Rotation?
In mathematics, when the *basis* of a vector space is changed, the same object is represented in a completely different coordinate system.  
For instance, what was once described in “vertical and horizontal” coordinates can be re-expressed as “diagonal and orthogonal.”  

**Enlightenment, I suggest, is such a basis rotation.**  

The external world remains the same, the self remains the same, yet at a certain moment, the *entire system of meaning* is transformed.  
It is as if the coordinate system of the mind itself has rotated.

## AI Tuning and the Calibration of the Mind
AI models change dramatically when parameters close to the basis are adjusted.  
Minor processes such as fine-tuning or regularization can transform how the model perceives and responds.  

Human enlightenment may share the same structure.  
When the *basis itself* that underlies countless qualia, emotions, and thoughts undergoes rotation,  
anger and attachment naturally fade, and one sees the world anew—free from suffering.

## Enlightenment as Catastrophic Shift
Psychologically, enlightenment is not “gradual growth” but rather a **phase transition—a sudden leap.**  
A mental model abruptly shifts to a new configuration.  

This is isomorphic to a “basis rotation in latent space” in AI,  
and thus the “basis rotation hypothesis” provides a useful scientific metaphor for satori.

## Future Directions
- **Cognitive and Neuroscientific Testing**  
  Could EEG or fMRI reveal sudden phase shifts or reconfigurations of representational spaces during states of enlightenment?  
- **AI Tuning and Mental Calibration**  
  Just as embedding spaces can be rotated, can the basis of the mind be deliberately tuned through practice?  
- **Dialogue between Philosophy and Religion**  
  An “algorithmic Buddhism of the mind,” linking Eastern thought and the AI age.

## Conclusion
Enlightenment is not mere mysticism, but a **basis rotation in the vector space of qualia.**  
In that moment, one re-experiences the world in a new coordinate system.  

This hypothesis may serve as a cross-disciplinary bridge across philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and AI research.  
It also suggests that methods for tuning AI could inspire *new practices of enlightenment* for the human mind.
