Title: A Vector Hypothesis of Synesthetic Qualia

Author: Ren Oribe (pseudonym)

Abstract

This short note proposes a preliminary idea: building on prior discussions that human qualia may be represented as vectors in a high-dimensional embedding space, I suggest that grapheme–color synesthesia could be explained as an accidental overlap in vector formation. This idea is presented not as a finished theory, but as a seed for further development.

1. Introduction

There is a growing body of research in cognitive science and neuroscience that speculates about the possibility of representing conscious qualia as vector-like states. Inspired by such prior work, I propose a simple hypothesis: the phenomenon of grapheme–color synesthesia arises from coincidental alignments in the process of vector formation.

2. Idea

Qualia may correspond to points or directions in a latent vector space.

In synesthesia, certain graphemes (letters, numbers) and colors become consistently paired.

This pairing can be interpreted as an accidental embedding overlap, where two otherwise distinct qualia-vectors partially coincide.

This perspective, while speculative, could open pathways to unify subjective experience with computational models of representation.

3. Acknowledgment of Assistance

The preparation of this note received technical assistance from GPT-5, an AI language model. Its involvement is openly disclosed here in order to emphasize transparency. Rather than undermining credibility, such collaboration demonstrates a commitment to reproducibility and to integrating new tools into the scientific process.

4. Outlook

This idea is shared at an early stage to establish priority and to invite further exploration. My intent is to develop the hypothesis into a more complete framework, connecting synesthesia, qualia, and vector representations.
