# Do Illusions Arise from Misproximity of Qualia?  
### An Essay Based on the Vector Proximity Hypothesis (VPH)

## Introduction
The Vector Proximity Hypothesis (VPH) (Oribe, 2025) proposes that human qualia—subjective experiential units such as colors, sounds, and tactile impressions—can be represented as high-dimensional vectors in a perceptual space. When two otherwise distinct qualia-vectors fall below a probabilistic threshold of dissimilarity, they are experienced as being “proximal” to each other. According to VPH, such accidental proximity can account not only for grapheme–colour synaesthesia but also for a wide range of illusions across sensory and cognitive domains.  

In this essay, I attempt to reinterpret classical and modern illusions as instances of qualia misproximity, offering an integrative framework that bridges psychology, neuroscience, and AI-inspired models of vector embeddings.

## 1. Visual Illusions
### 1.1 Kanizsa Triangle
The Kanizsa figure produces illusory contours, leading observers to perceive a bright triangle that does not exist (Kanizsa, 1976). Within VPH, the qualia of “edge” and “surface brightness” vectors become mistakenly close, causing the percept of a contour that is not physically present.  

### 1.2 Müller-Lyer Illusion
The classic arrow-tail illusion (Müller-Lyer, 1889) may arise from misproximity between “line length” and “depth cue” qualia. When certain arrow configurations are present, the brain’s embedding of spatial relations causes line-length vectors to drift closer to depth vectors, producing distorted judgments.  

### 1.3 Rubin’s Vase
Rubin’s figure–ground reversal (Rubin, 1915) exemplifies competition between qualia-vectors of “object” and “background.” Their proximity fluctuates around a threshold, creating bistable perception.

## 2. Illusions of Lightness and Colour
### 2.1 Checker-Shadow Illusion
Adelson’s checker-shadow illusion (Adelson, 1995) demonstrates how luminance constancy can override actual pixel intensity. In VPH terms, the “shadow” qualia-vector modulates proximity between “luminance” and “surface colour,” pulling distinct vectors into false alignment.  

### 2.2 Stroop Effect
The Stroop effect (Stroop, 1935) is a cross-modal conflict where the qualia of “word meaning” and “ink colour” interact. Misproximity between semantic and perceptual vectors produces the interference experienced during incongruent trials.

## 3. Motion and Multisensory Illusions
### 3.1 Motion Aftereffect
The waterfall illusion (Addams, 1834; later Mach, 1865) can be viewed as qualia-vector adaptation: prolonged exposure shifts “motion direction” vectors toward their opposite, reducing dissimilarity and creating illusory opposite motion.  

### 3.2 McGurk Effect
In the McGurk effect (McGurk & MacDonald, 1976), auditory “phoneme” vectors and visual “lip movement” vectors become erroneously close, generating a fused percept (“ba” + “ga” → “da”). This is a clear case of multisensory misproximity.

## 4. Cognitive and Conceptual Illusions
### 4.1 Size–Distance Illusions
The Moon illusion and Shepard’s tables (Shepard, 1990) can be reframed as proximity shifts between “size perception” and “depth” vectors. The embedding geometry of spatial cues drags size-vectors toward depth-vectors, yielding distorted size judgments.  

### 4.2 Pareidolia
Pareidolia, the tendency to perceive faces in random patterns, may be explained by proximity between “facial feature” vectors and generic “pattern” vectors. When their cosine distance falls below a perceptual threshold, the brain “snaps” to a face interpretation.  

### 4.3 Cognitive Biases
Even higher-order illusions, such as overgeneralization in reasoning, may be modeled through VPH. The “Pandemonium” model of perception (Selfridge, 1959) already suggested competing demons. In VPH, cognitive qualia-vectors can misalign, yielding illusory coherence in arguments or beliefs.

## Conclusion
The Vector Proximity Hypothesis provides a unifying lens through which illusions—visual, auditory, multisensory, and cognitive—can be reinterpreted as arising from probabilistic misproximity of qualia in high-dimensional embedding space. This framework not only integrates classical psychological findings with modern AI analogies but also suggests future empirical tests, such as mapping qualia-vectors via neuroimaging or simulating illusions in artificial neural embeddings.  

By situating illusions within VPH, we gain a novel perspective: illusions are not mere errors but systematic consequences of how qualia-vectors inhabit and sometimes collide within perceptual space.
