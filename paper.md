## Abstract  
This paper proposes the **Vector Proximity Hypothesis (VPH)**, which models human qualia as high-dimensional vectors.  
According to this hypothesis, probabilistic proximity between otherwise distinct qualia-vectors can give rise to phenomena such as grapheme‚Äìcolour synaesthesia.

1. Introduction

Vector embeddings have become foundational in natural language processing (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014). For example:

king
‚àí
man
+
woman
‚âà
queen
.
king‚àíman+woman‚âàqueen.

Yet embeddings also misclassify. In Natural Language Inference (NLI), BERT models rely on surface heuristics and misjudge unrelated sentences as similar (McCoy et al., 2019; Niven & Kao, 2019).

This suggests an analogy: if human qualia are also vectors (Churchland, 1995; Kanai & Tsuchiya, 2012), then accidental proximity in qualia-space might explain grapheme‚Äìcolour synaesthesia.

2. Background
2.1 Prevalence of Synesthesia

Epidemiological studies report overall synaesthesia prevalence of ~4.4%, while grapheme‚Äìcolour synaesthesia is observed in ~1‚Äì2% of the population (Simner et al., 2006; Watson et al., 2017).

2.2 Competing Theories

Cross-activation theory: cortical proximity between grapheme and colour areas (Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001; Hubbard, 2005). Supported by DTI evidence of increased structural connectivity (Rouw & Scholte, 2007).

Ideasthesia: synaesthesia depends on the semantic meaning of stimuli (Mroczko-WƒÖsowicz & Nikoliƒá, 2014).

2.3 Toward VPH

These theories are not mutually exclusive. VPH integrates structural connectivity and semantic dependence via vector-space geometry.

3. The Vector Proximity Hypothesis (VPH)
### 3.1 Definition of Dissimilarity

Dissimilarity between qualia is defined as:

**Equation (1)**: Cosine dissimilarity between qualia vectors, where Œ∏·µ¢‚±º is the angle between qualia vectors q·µ¢ and q‚±º.*

### 3.2 Condition for Synaesthesia

Condition for grapheme‚Äìcolour synaesthesia:

**Equation (2)**: Synaesthesia occurs when dissimilarity falls below the probabilistic threshold œÑ, where œÑ is an empirically estimated threshold.*


4. Applications
4.1 Explaining Grapheme‚ÄìColour Synaesthesia

VPH accounts for prevalence (~1‚Äì2%), structural connectivity, and semantic dependence.

4.2 Extension to Illusions

Kanizsa triangle (Kanizsa, 1976)

Shepard‚Äôs tables (Shepard, 1990)

M√ºller‚ÄìLyer illusion (M√ºller-Lyer, 1889)

All may be explained by vector misproximity.

4.3 AI Hallucination

Hallucination in large language models (Ji et al., 2023) can be seen as a form of vector misalignment. This view suggests improvements in contrastive learning and debiasing embeddings (Levy & Goldberg, 2014).

5. Empirical Protocols
5.1 fMRI + RSA

Stimuli: graphemes and colours.

Extract multi-voxel patterns, compute Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs), compare with model RDMs (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008).

Statistical tests: permutation tests, FDR correction.

5.2 Hyperalignment

Inter-subject variability is normalized via hyperalignment (Haxby et al., 2011).

5.3 AI Simulation

Artificially manipulate proximity thresholds 
ùúè
œÑ in embeddings (BERT/GPT) and compare with NLI misclassifications.

7. Discussion

VPH unifies structural connectivity, semantic dependence, and vector geometry. A single mechanism‚Äîprobabilistic vector proximity‚Äîaccounts for synaesthesia, illusions, and AI hallucinations. This provides a parsimonious framework, consistent with Occam‚Äôs razor.
